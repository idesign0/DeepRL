# DeepRL 🤖

This repository explores **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for robotics**, with a gradual transition from classical reward-based RL to **Deep Reinforcement Learning**.

The initial focus is on **robotic manipulation** in simulation, using **MuJoCo**, where a Google robotic arm (007) learns to **pick up a cube purely through reward and penalty signals**, without hard-coded trajectories or heuristics.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
- RL-based **pick-and-place manipulation**
- Pure **reward–penalty driven learning**
- **MuJoCo simulation**
- Google robot (007) arm
- Limited manipulation task space (for controlled learning)

---

## 🔜 Planned Extensions
- Transition from classical RL → **Deep RL**
- More complex manipulation tasks
- **Navigation + manipulation** (moving the cube to different locations)
- Integration with perception (vision-based observations)
- Benchmarking different RL algorithms

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- MuJoCo
- Reinforcement Learning frameworks (to be extended)
- Robotics-focused simulation workflows

---

## 📌 Motivation
This project is part of a long-term exploration into:
- Learning-based control for robots
- Scalability of RL in real-world robotics
- Bridging manipulation and navigation under a unified RL framework
